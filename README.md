TES5EditScripts
===============

TES5EditScripts is a collection of several scripts written in pascal 
which allow for the execution of useful functions for the editing and 
creation of Bethesda plugin files.  These scripts were developed with 
TES5Edit in mind, though many of them work fine in other versions of 
Edit as well.  These scripts will allow you to save huge chunks of time 
when creating mods for Bethesda games.
